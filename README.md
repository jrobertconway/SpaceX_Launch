# SpaceX_Launch
Data Science project about rocket launches and how to be cost efficient

SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age making space travel affordable the company advertises falcon and I rocket launches on its website with the cost of $62 million other providers cost upward of $165 million each much of the savings is because space can be used the first stage. 
Therefore, if we determine if the first stage of land, we can determine the first cost of the launch based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict a SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

Problems you want to find answers:

How do variable such as payload mass launch site number of flights and orbit affects the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?
